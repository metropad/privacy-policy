**Effective Date:** August 12, 2024

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to Metropad. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle your information and the measures we take to protect it. By using Metropad, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## 2. Data Collection

Metropad is designed with your privacy in mind. We do not collect or transmit any personal data over the internet. The only information that Metropad accesses or transmits is essential for the functioning of the app and is limited to device identifiers on the local network.

### 2.1 Device Identifiers

To facilitate the use of Ableton Link, Metropad requires the transmission of device identifiers over the local network. These identifiers are used solely to enable synchronization and communication between devices running Metropad and other Link-enabled apps or hardware. 

### 2.2 Local Network Data Transmission

All data transmitted by Metropad remains within your local network. We do not transmit, share, or store any of this information on external servers or over the internet.

## 3. Data Usage

The data we access (device identifiers) is used exclusively for the purpose of enabling Ableton Link functionality within Metropad. This allows your devices to synchronize tempo, beat, and other timing information with other Link-enabled apps or hardware in real-time.

## 4. Data Security

We take your privacy seriously and employ reasonable measures to protect the data used by Metropad. Since no data is transmitted over the internet or stored on external servers, the risk of unauthorized access is minimized.

## 5. Third-Party Services

Metropad does not use third-party services that collect, transmit, or store your data. The app operates independently within your local network, ensuring that your data remains private and secure.

## 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
